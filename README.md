# Key Generator
This is a simple C++ program that generates keys based on input data. It takes two different approaches based on the user's choice:

1. Generate Keys: Reads input data from "projectinput.txt" and generates keys based on specific rules. The keys are then written to "projectinput_keys.txt".

2. Merge Keys with Input: Reads keys from "projectinput_keys.txt" and input data from "projectinput.txt". It merges the two files and writes the final output to "projectinput_final.txt".

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/LegionDotEXE/your-repo.git
```
