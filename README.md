# ProductID-Keygen
C++/DSA Final Project Submission

# Key Generator
This is a simple C++ program that generates keys based on input data. It takes two different approaches based on the user's choice:

1. Generate Keys: Reads input data from "projectinput.txt" and generates keys based on specific rules. The keys are then written to "projectinput_keys.txt".

2. Merge Keys with Input: Reads keys from "projectinput_keys.txt" and input data from "projectinput.txt". It merges the two files and writes the final output to "projectinput_final.txt".

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/LegionDotEXE/your-repo.git
```
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
```
g++ key_generator.cpp -o key_generator
```
   
3. Run the executable and follow the on-screen instructions:
```
./key_generator
```

4. Choose either option 1 or option 2 based on your requirement.

5. If you choose option 1, the generated keys will be saved to "projectinput_keys.txt".

6. If you choose option 2, the merged output will be saved to "projectinput_final.txt".

## Input Files

Ensure you have the required input files in the same directory as the executable:

- `projectinput.txt`: Contains the input data without keys.
- `projectinput_keys.txt`: Contains keys (generated using option 1) or existing keys.
 
## Output Files

The generated keys (option 1) will be written to `projectinput_keys.txt`.

The merged output (option 2) will be written to `projectinput_final.txt`.
